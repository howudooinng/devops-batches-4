HEAD -- Means, it is pinter which stays on the current version of the file in the git version control system. whatever recent commit you have done, the HEAD will be pointed to that commit only.

git log -- shows full details of the log
git log --oneline --> shows only the id of the commit and commit message
git log --oneline --pretty --> shows full log but the commit id will be shortened.

BRANCH in git --

Root User -- Branch --

Main root - MASTER Branch
When there is a folder created, that is called a Master Branch
Master Branch -- New Branch (Developement Branch) -- whatever code is there i new branch comes from the root branch and whatever changes I am doing in this branch, it doesn't affect the main/master branch.

Main Project -- create a new branch -- branch is a separate copy of the same repo, and you can make whwtever changes you want and it will not affect the Master Branch.


So how does this branching works:

When we are creating a new branch from the Master/Main branch, all the code or current repo data moves to the new branch which we created, so now if we change any change in the file of the new branch, it will be there only int eh created branch and not in the main branch, as it is a complete separate branch from the MAster/Main branch.


So dev changes will stay in dev branch and the master branch will be holding the changes which it curently has overall.

git branch --> command which shows the current branch on which git is.

github, gitlab, bitbucket -- underlying Logic is GIT, and these are different companies using Git, That's it.


git clone "use the http;// url give in the repository code dropdown"
to clone the repo to your folder -- personal folder-- only public repos can be cloned


ubuntu@ip-172-31-36-60:~/howudooinng-git-profile/devops-batch-4$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/howudooinng/devops-batch-4.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/howudooinng/devops-batch-4.git (push)
ubuntu@ip-172-31-36-60:~/howudooinng-git-profile/devops-batch-4$


git remote -v shows the orgin for Push and fetch for the repo


clone vs fork -

clone create  the local version of the remote repo
fork createa the repo under your name -- as it is copy is there of github and you can work on that and move the changes to the original repo
