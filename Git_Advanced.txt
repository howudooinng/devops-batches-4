A repo has branches. 
We never do any commit to the MASTER Branch.
Git add, Git Commit is never done at the Master branch --> never commit to this branch
Master branch is the protected branch and never touch that at industry level.

Master - has the protected codebase(Stable release, latest stable release)
QA team checks the Master --> Staging Branch -- multiple people come and test -- if the staging is passed by the QA and then it becomes the prod and then it becomes the Master codebase.
To reach Staging branch -- we have the DEV branch -- me as a developer will pick the code form there, that branch where development is done.
A Developer takes a pull from the dev branch -- and works on the Feature branch of that dev branch.

BRANCHING STRATEGIES:

MASTER 
STAGING 
DEVELOP -- FEATURE1, FEATURE2, FEATURE3

HOTFIX -- IT IS DONE WHEN THERE IS A VERY CRITICAL ERROR AND THEN A BRANCH IS TAKEN FROM THE STAGING OR MASTER AND THEN MERGE IT DIRECTLY TO MASTER OR GO THROUGH STAGING TO MASTER AFTER RESOLUTION.

MNC'S USE JIRA -- THEY CREATE TICKETS 

MASTER -- PRD
STAGING -- STG
DEVELOP -- DEV

HEAD - POINTS LATEST COMMIT

SO EACH BRANCH HAS A HEAD AT THE LATEST COMMIT OF THAT BRANCH.
